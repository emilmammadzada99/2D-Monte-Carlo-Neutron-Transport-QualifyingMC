# 2D Monte Carlo Neutron Transport Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation of neutron transport within a 2D cylindrical fuel cell. The model tracks neutron interactions such as scattering, capture, fission, and leakage, and compares the resulting neutron flux spectrum with a standard Watt spectrum.

The simulation is inspired by academic research on Monte Carlo modeling of neutron interactions, such as the thesis:

"Modeling Neutron Interaction Inside a 2D Reactor Using Monte Carlo Method"  
A.S.M. Fakhrul Islam, University of South Carolina, 2019

## Features
- Maxwellian-distributed neutron source
- Geometry: fuel, cladding, and moderator
- Interaction types: scattering, capture, fission
- Energy-dependent cross sections
- Visualization of neutron trajectories and flux spectrum
